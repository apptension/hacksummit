            <h1>Peer evaluation. Gamified.</h1>
            <p>We get it, filling out endless questionnaires is boring.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, feedback provided within the team is especially valuable for the manager - it is based on actual work experience. To make this task seem effortless, we created a system of browser and email notifications, which can be answered by users whenever they feel like it.</p>
            <p>There is a gamification element to Propsy - people who answer the most questions and provide the most extensive feedback are named Top Contributors. This title comes with bragging rights, being present on everyone’s dashboards and possibly an additional award from your company?</p>
